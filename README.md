# Chick-Fil-A Rewards Remodel

A new and improved reward system for Chick Fil A.
            
## App purpose
Serves to represent how Signature Chick-Fil-A members can, and should, receive rewards more tailored to their purchases when local Chick-Fil-A Owner-Operators send out rewards.

## Customer
Similar to the Chick-Fil-A app, this app simulates a customer purchasing menu items, receiving points and reaching a higher status every time a certain amount of points is acquired.
                                        
## Operator
Represents the local Owner-Operator who sends out rewards to customers when they're feeling generous. At the press of a button, the customer(s) receive their reward based on their reward status.
